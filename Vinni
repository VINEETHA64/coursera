			<div>Chicken<p>Healthy kids' menus. Growing awareness of the rise in childhood obesity2﻿ has prompted a new wave of healthy children's menus. Though many restaurants still offer "kid food" such as mac and cheese, pizza, or fried chicken strips, others are finding ways to introduce young diners to a greater variety of dishes, including more produce. Hummus with vegetables for dipping, fruit salads, whole grain pasta, and roasted vegetable chips are all ways to update your own children's menu so it appeals to health-conscious parents as well as to kids. Even fast-food restaurants now offer many healthy food options for kids, such as grilled chicken wraps, yogurt, and apple slices</p></div>
